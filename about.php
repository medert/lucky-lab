            Because Labs — amongst other breeds — are more often euthanized at
            shelters! It’s hard to imagine, but sometimes people adopt a cute
            lab puppy and when the dog displays “lab energy," it gets turned
            to a shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most labs that come to Lucky Lab Rescue & Adoption were most at
            risk of euthanasia, usually due to overcrowded shelters.

            The most popular color of Labs are the yellow & chocolate, leaving
            black labs less likely to being adopted. Some shelters will
            automatically euthanize black labs. Rescue organizations have
            accepted the yellow and chocolate over the black labs, too. We at
            Lucky Lab Rescue & Adoption feel very committed to rescuing black
            Labs too, due to their plight as they are often overlooked in favor
            of lighter-colored dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucky Lab’s about more than finding dogs and cats great forever
            homes. We also raise awareness regarding animal welfare and the
            importance of spay and neuter and its role in helping control pet
            overpopulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most Lucky Lab come from high-kill shelters in Virginia, West
            Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Puerto Rico.  We work
            with shelter partners in low-income and rural areas where hundreds
            of highly-adoptable dogs are euthanized each month due to
            overpopulation problems, lack of spay/neuter education and
            inadequate funding. We also help some international animals in
            need, including dogs rescued from the meat trades in Thailand &
            South Korea, dogs from the streets of Kosovo, and dogs displaced
            by natural disasters in the Caribbean.
