          <h3>ADOPT</h3>
          <p>
            Gorgeous, sweet and beautiful! Meet Maddie!
            Maddie is a super-sweet, loving, 2 year old female lab mix who is looking for her forever family.
            She is eager to give her unconditional love to anyone who will accept it.
            Once she gets ear-scritches from a new “stranger,” she’s their BFF for life.
            </p>
            <p>
            She is most content when snuggling with her two-legged family on the couch, and she enjoys watching TV!
            The way she crosses her paws like a proper lady when sitting at leisure is adorable!
            She has a calm demeanor and is pretty chill,right up until dinnertime, when she leaps for joy at the
            sight of her food bowl – dinnertime is the highlight of her day.

          <h3>VOLUNTEER</h3>
          <p>
            As a volunteer-powered non-profit organization, Lucky Lab would not exist without the hard work
            and dedication of our volunteers. The number of dogs and cats we can save depends on the number
            of people we have helping us. We are always looking for new volunteers!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many ways you can volunteer with Lucky Lab. From the early stages of preparing for
             our animal’s arrival, to meeting them at transport, to helping at adoption events, and then
            following up after adoption, every step along on our animal’s journey relies on volunteers.

            <h3>DONATE</h3>
            <p>
              Donations help pay for spaying, neutering, vaccinations, heart-worm tests and treatments,
              microchipping and even emergency surgery. As an all-volunteer rescue, we cannot operate without
              help! Whether it’s donating a few dollars or helping us fundraise, you are part of making a huge
              difference in a dog’s life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lucky Dog accepts donations online and by mail to our office.
              We also accept in kind donations of supplies for our shelter partners.
              Please contact us to coordinate drop-off or pick-up.
